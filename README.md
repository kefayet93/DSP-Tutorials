# Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS)
Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) or Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) is a critical component in modern digital communication systems, particularly for 5G communications. The applications of DDS/NCO extend to:
1. Digital up/down converters in radio transmitters/receivers
2. Digital Phase-Locked Loop (D-PLL)
3. Direct-RF waveform synthesis at GHz range for intermediate frequency (IF) millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) radios
4.  Direct-RF signal generation for Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

This repository contains a DDS code implemented using Python.
