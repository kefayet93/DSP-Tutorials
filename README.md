# Least Squares FIR Filter Design: Applications in DSP Wireless System Design

## What is Least-Squares FIR Filter Design?
**The total channel (Tx + Channel + Rx) response can be modeled using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter: 

$$     y[n] = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{L-1} h[k]. x[n-k] $$

## Importance in DSP and Wireless System Design
* **Channel Estimation:** estimating the channel impulse response of a multipath wireless channel and perform channel equalization at the receiver for phase, time, and carrier synchronization.
